Laradar automatically **discovers, visualizes, and documents** your Laravel application architecture - without writing a single line of configuration.

Drop it into any Laravel project and instantly get an interactive dashboard that maps your models, controllers, routes, migrations, jobs, events, services, and more. Optionally enhance it with AI-powered architecture insights from any of 7 supported providers.

---

## Why Laradar?

As a Laravel application grows, understanding its full structure becomes harder. New team members spend days reading code to understand what exists. Developers duplicate logic because they didn't know a service already existed. Architecture decisions get made without a clear picture of the whole.

Laradar gives everyone on the team - from the developer who wrote it to the one who just joined - an instant, accurate map of the application. No documentation to maintain. No diagrams to keep updated. Just install and the dashboard reflects the real state of the project at all times.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Install the package:**

```bash
composer require vcian/laradar
```

**2. Publish the config:**

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laradar-config
```

**3. Visit the dashboard:**

```
http://your-app.test/laradar
```

> The dashboard is only accessible when `APP_ENV=local` or `APP_ENV=development`. It is automatically disabled in production.

## Dashboard

<div align="center">

![Laradar Dashboard](art/dashboard.png)

</div>

Laradar scans your application once on page load and presents all data instantly.

| Section | What you see |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Architecture score, component counts, and an interactive architecture flowchart |
| **Models** | Table mappings, fillable fields, hidden fields, casts, and relationships |
| **Controllers** | Methods, route bindings, and class dependencies |
| **Routes** | Full route list with HTTP method, URI, middleware, name, and controller |
| **Migrations** | Every migration file with its table operation, column types, and foreign keys |
| **Jobs** | Queue connections and class hierarchy |
| **Events** | Listeners and broadcast channels |
| **Services** | All classes discovered in `App\Services` |
| **Repositories** | All classes discovered in `App\Repositories` |
| **Observers** | Observed models and registered event hooks |
| **Policies** | Guarded models and defined abilities |
| **Middleware** | All registered middleware and their aliases |
| **Modules** | Modular structure detection from `Modules/` directory |
| **Packages** | Installed Composer packages with version information |
| **AI Insights** | AI-powered review of your architecture (requires AI configuration) |

## Artisan Reports

Generate a full architecture report without opening the browser:

```bash
php artisan laradar:scan
```

Export in a specific format:

```bash
php artisan laradar:scan --format=html
php artisan laradar:scan --format=json
php artisan laradar:scan --format=markdown
```

Reports are saved to `storage/architecture/`. The HTML report is also viewable in the browser at `http://your-app.test/laradar/report`.

---

## Configuration

```php
// config/laradar.php

return [
    'dashboard' => [
        'enabled'    => true,
        'path'       => 'laradar',       // dashboard URL: /laradar
        'middleware' => ['web'],
    ],

    'scan' => [
        'models'       => true,
        'controllers'  => true,
        'routes'       => true,
        'migrations'   => true,
        'jobs'         => true,
        'events'       => true,
        'services'     => true,
        'repositories' => true,
        'observers'    => true,
        'policies'     => true,
        'modules'      => true,
        'packages'     => true,
    ],

    'ai' => [
        'enabled'  => env('AI_ENABLED', false),
        'provider' => env('AI_PROVIDER', 'gemini'),

        // Async queue (optional — see Async AI section below)
        'async'       => env('LARADAR_AI_ASYNC', false),
        'queue'       => env('LARADAR_AI_QUEUE', 'default'),
        'job_timeout' => env('LARADAR_AI_JOB_TIMEOUT', 300),
    ],
];
```

## AI Analysis

Laradar can send your architecture summary to an AI provider and return an architectural review directly inside the dashboard.

Enable it in your `.env`:

```env
AI_ENABLED=true
AI_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash   # the model used for the architecture review
```

**Supported providers:**

| Provider | `AI_PROVIDER` | API Key | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google Gemini | `gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `GEMINI_MODEL` |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `OPENAI_MODEL` |
| Anthropic Claude | `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` |
| Groq | `groq` | `GROQ_API_KEY` | `GROQ_MODEL` |
| Mistral | `mistral` | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | `MISTRAL_MODEL` |
| Ollama *(local, no key needed)* | `ollama` | — | `OLLAMA_MODEL` |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `OPENROUTER_MODEL` |

---

## Async AI (Queue)

By default, AI requests (Analyze and Generate Docs) run synchronously — the browser waits for the AI provider to respond before the page updates. For large projects this can take 20–30 seconds and block the PHP worker during that time.

You can make AI requests non-blocking by running them as background queue jobs.

**1. Set up the jobs table (one time):**

```bash
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
```

**2. Enable async in `.env`:**

```env
LARADAR_AI_ASYNC=true
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

**3. Start the queue worker (second terminal):**

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

That's it. When you click **Analyze** or **Generate Docs** in the dashboard, the request returns immediately and the result appears automatically once the job completes — no page refresh needed.

**Optional env keys:**

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LARADAR_AI_ASYNC` | `false` | Enable background job processing for AI requests |
| `LARADAR_AI_QUEUE` | `default` | Queue name to dispatch AI jobs on |
| `LARADAR_AI_JOB_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Max seconds the AI job is allowed to run |

> **Note:** If your application already uses queues for its own jobs, set `LARADAR_AI_QUEUE=laradar` and run a dedicated worker `php artisan queue:work --queue=laradar` so AI jobs don't compete with your application jobs.

## Upgrading

When upgrading Laradar, if you have a published `config/laradar.php`, re-publish it to get new config keys:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laradar-config --force
php artisan optimize:clear
```
